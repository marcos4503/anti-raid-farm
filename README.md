# About this Mod

This mod was developed to mitigate how OP farms based on intentional Raids on Villages are in the game. If you want to curb these abuses, this mod is for you. Not to mention that the idea of â€‹â€‹a player forcing Raids on Villages with innocent Villagers, just to obtain resources, is quite disturbing. ðŸ˜‚

This mod does the following:
- Set a cooldown for creating Raids. After a player with the "Bad Omen" effect enters a Village and starts a Raid, an internal cooldown will begin, and they will only be able to start another Raid if the cooldown reaches zero. This cooldown is configurable by you.
- The cooldown persists even after the player dies. And it cannot be redefined by any means.
- The player can no longer remove the "Bad Omen" effect by drinking milk. Any item with the word "milk" in its ID should be considered milk by this mod. This behavior is configurable too.

# Compatibility
